- 👋 Hi, I’m Lazar Radosavljević (@lazar-rad). I have a degree in Applied and Computational Physics from the University of Belgrade.
Currently I am studying for the masters degree in Computer Science at the University of Belgrade School of Electrical Engineering
- 👀 I am mostly interested in embedded systems, microcontrollers, system programming and operating systems.
- 🖥️ I am fluent in C/C++ and Python and have a decent understanding of Java. I know a bit of Go and would like to learn Rust. I hate JavaScript. And my first programming language was Pascal.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have recently discovered Nightwish’s music! I adore their album “Endless Forms Most Beautiful”
